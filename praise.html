                    <p class="testimonial-text">Nancy's Living in Joy and Grace coaching program has been the greatest gift I have ever given myself! Her intuition, warmth, positivity, complete honesty, sense of humour and non-judgemental approach made me feel instantly trusting and at ease with her. Opening up to her guidance and spiritual perspective on everything allowed me to see everything in my life in a completely new way.</p>
                    
                    <p class="testimonial-text">When I first began working with Nancy, I felt energetically drained, overwhelmed and frazzled. Through her guidance and coaching, I've come to a place where I am more spiritually connected, clear, inspired, and living life from a place of joy and purpose! I have discovered my dharma, and with her support am now creating my mission of coaching and supporting women and mothers. The powerful tools she has shared with me, I've also incorporated into my everyday life to the benefit of every aspect of my life, personally, professionally and spiritually. She is a truly amazing person and I am so blessed to have found her!</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">As an Intuitive Coach, Nancy does powerful energy and coaching work. Her Living in Joy and Grace Program helps you to claim your Intuition, your joy, your Divinity! Like the GPS in your car, her voice will lovingly guide you to access your soul wisdom and manifest lavishly. Her presence of Light will move you to inspired action going from "stuck" to alignment. (And let me tell you, I know "stuck" well!)</p>
                    
                    <p class="testimonial-text">As a Coach, I am deeply grateful for the sharing of her wisdom, her intuitive best practices and more importantly, how she has helped me to pause and create a better life story. And finally, it would be remiss of me not to share this... her favourite word is "Yes" with a question mark! Yes, you will indeed be served all this and more. Not too shabby, yes?</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">Dear Nancy, I wish to share with you the unique experience that I've had with The Realignment.</p>
                    
                    <p class="testimonial-text">Thank you so much for empowering me to listen to my heart and to my own intuitive guidance. I need to look within, not just "with out", always seeking the approval of others. I have felt more determined, clearer in purpose since The Realignment.</p>
                    
                    <p class="testimonial-text">Slowly, like the peeling of an onion, or a butterfly in its cocoon, I feel that I am starting new and fresh. With much gratitude for sharing your Divine-ness and for lovingly supporting me to find my own Divine-ness and ultimately, my joy!!</p>
                    
                    <p class="testimonial-text">With love, light and blessings to you, Nancy, as you continue on your path and to support others to re-connect with themselves and their joy!</p>

                <div class="testimonial-card">
                    <p class="testimonial-text">Our sessions together were so powerful for me and I keep going back to the transcripts you made for me to re-energize myself, and it is so powerful and inspiring. I had to share them with my wife this weekend as we were traveling, basically the underlying message, and she was really stoked for me as well. This week I'm going to be contacting a couple of health food stores and yoga studios to organize a short talk and maybe a food demonstration. Haven't figured out yet if I'm going to talk about superfoods or fermented foods as they are both critical pieces for health at this point I feel. So yes, you and your guides have powerfully and divinely inspired me and I feel like my fog that I was in is finally beginning to lift. I've been asking for guidance and to be filled with love, peace, and light morning and night and it feels wonderful. I feel so divinely inspired and it keeps growing, little by little, day by day. I can feel it.</p>
                    
                    <p class="testimonial-text">My overall connection with the divine, my higher self, guides, etc. seem to be accelerating and I honestly feel so connected. This past week I was in such a funk. I applied some of the things you shared with me in our sessions and I can honestly say the clouds have been cleared and my vibration has been taken to the next level, I mean whoa. I feel so clear, happy, and inspired right now and I have the feeling it's going to get even better. Thanks again for your guidance and support!</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">When I had my first session with Nancy and her wonderful guides, I was feeling really afraid of what my future was to hold. I had a lot of changes going on from finances to my marriage and my career. I was in a place of fear and my whole body was feeling it. My neck was tight and I was not feeling that great!</p>
                    
                    <p class="testimonial-text">The minute I heard her voice on the line, I could feel such a shift in my spirit! The knowledge and reassurance that was given to me I still listen to today. Nancy's guidance was so warm and loving. It made me understand in my gut, that I would be ok and that I need to let go of my fears! Love is always around us!</p>
                    
                    <p class="testimonial-text">Nancy has such a TREMENDOUS gift! Her coaching made a huge impact on my life! My career is taking off and I am understanding what my true gifts really are! Thank you Nancy…</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">I came to know Nancy at a time when I could find no peace or comfort. After much struggle and searching, it was only through her Channeled Light Sessions that I was given the insight to understand how I had ended up at the place I was at. Her insight and guidance planted the seeds I needed to be able to begin on a new path and way of being. Today, Nancy's sessions continue to bring clarity, peace and comfort for me as I walk on what I now know is the right path for me. Thank you Nancy, for the life changing experience.</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">Despite sworn testimonials to Ms. Peel's abilities from a trusted source, I was admittedly skeptical before our first Session. Within five minutes, I changed my mind. Nancy was effortlessly accurate and completely reassuring as we explored past, present and future areas of my life formerly plagued with doubt, concern and lack of clarity. In all my sessions with Nancy I've been consistently rewarded with direction, inspiration and closure. Her guidance and coaching has been invaluable to me.</p>

                <div class="testimonial-card">
                    <p class="testimonial-text">For more than 10 years, I have been a client of Nancy and experienced the results and wisdom of her Channeled Light Sessions and Intuitive Coaching. I have been able to work with her, not to see into the future, but to get another point of view on situations that have crept into my life from time to time. Many times, in times of utter panic, Nancy's sessions have provided the sane, calm, quiet, loving – always loving, voice into my own higher self, to assist me in gaining a perspective which has always produced a centering result. So often, I have not been able to clearly see any other options other than the self-imposed ones of the ego, and without fail, her sessions created space for me to take a deep breath and see there are always other ways of seeing something and taking action. No matter how much I falter, she and her guides always allow me to 'be' and provide me with loving guidance and counsel and a light into my own awareness. I am grateful to Nancy for providing the Intuitive channel that has given me so much support and positive feedback through the years and look forward to our next session. Thank you both.</p>
