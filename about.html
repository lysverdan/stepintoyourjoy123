                    <h2>Hello,</h2>
                    
                    <p>For over 15 years, I have been supporting and empowering people through their own personal/spiritual transformations and helping them live their most joyful lives.</p>
                    
                    <p>Essentially, I support you in facing and moving through your greatest fears, letting go of negative belief systems and shedding your skin so to speak, so you can live the life you've always dreamt about.</p>
                    
                    <p>As a writer and coach living in the tropics (yes, Infinite Light & I created that... yay!), I work with women who are intuitive, sensitive and creative. They come to me to get clear, to gain insight, clear energies that they have picked up over the years and to learn and apply tools/strategies in both their personal and business lives that have them living their most amazing lives.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Working with me is not for the faint of heart</strong>, and once you do... your personal and professional life will reflect more of who you are. You'll be living your life from a truly authentic space. And that will give you a sense of true freedom to create a life you love waking up to each and every day.</p>

                <h2>My Philosophy</h2>
                
                <p>Our happiness and joy (at the core) are really found in connecting to the greater part of who we are beyond the physical and discovering/living our purpose or our most joyful expression of who we are. This is our true <strong>JOB (joy of being)</strong> in life and when we discover it, this is when true joy picks us up and won't let us go! :)</p>
                
                <p>Transformation can happen in an instant—it is that moment of "aha" when your energy shifts and you are lifted to new ways of being, seeing, and believing. Life transforms when you awaken and fully connect to your spiritual self (the greater part of who you are... <strong><em>your intuitive self</em></strong>), discover your purpose and share that purpose in inspired action with the world. That's when you will be living in a continuous state of happiness from where a true sense of freedom, joy and abundance naturally flow. It is what I refer to as the flow of Grace... and there is nothing else quite like that flow!</p>
                
                <div class="vision-box">
                    <p><strong>My vision for each of us is to be living our happiness and joy here and now.</strong></p>
                    <p>As we clear and return to our inner joy, following our purpose with love, we all begin to spread more light in the world.</p>
                    <p>And as we each embrace our greatest selves, we make room for others to do the same. And that kind of happy will change the world.</p>
